# üìä Uber Trip Data Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard

## üöÄ Project Overview  
This Power BI project was developed to analyze Uber trip data and generate actionable insights into booking behavior, revenue patterns, geographic demand, and operational efficiency. The solution includes an interactive three-part dashboard‚Äî**Overview Analysis**, **Time-Based Analysis**, and **Details Tab**‚Äîto help stakeholders explore trends and make data-driven decisions.

Built on a structured data model that integrates trip-level data with location metadata, the dashboards feature dynamic measure selectors, heatmaps, drill-through capabilities, bookmarks, and raw data export options. The objective was to deliver a scalable, user-friendly business intelligence solution tailored for ride-share analytics.

## üìç Situation  
With the ride-share industry experiencing rapid growth, understanding usage patterns, revenue drivers, and operational pain points has become crucial. A visual and interactive tool was needed to transform raw Uber trip data into meaningful insights.
